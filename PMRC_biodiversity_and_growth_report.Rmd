## Introduction <!-- Tim -->

## Methods: Data collection <!--  -->

Forest composition was sampled throughout the PMRC land parcel through the selection of survey plots that provide a representative sample of the local ecosystem and terrain diversity. Plots were designed using a method resembling that set forth in the USDA Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) plot design[^1]. See Figure 1 for a visual reference.

![Figure 1: Plot design sketch, to scale.](images/plot_design_sketch.png){width="295"} The 11.3-meter-radius plot is divided into 3 transect lines at 120 degree increments. Each transect line possesses a 3.59-meter-radius subplot, centered at 5.6 meters from the plot center.

Some data points were collected only on features residing within one of the 3 subplots or along the 3 transects, while others were measured throughout the entirety of the plot area. Measurements of trees, maple sap tubing, wildlife tracks, and tree-related microhabitats occurred throughout the entire plot. Understory composition, bryophytes, and coarse woody debris were primarily measured along the transect lines. Macrofungi measurements occurred within the 3 subplots.

## Results

### Vegetation structure <!-- Garrett -->

As shown in Figure 2 below, the plots predominately contain sugar maple, with sizeable fractions of American beech and yellow birch.
