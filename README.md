# PMRC Biodiversity Surveys
This repository documents biodiversity measurements taken across the University of Vermont (UVM) Proctor Maple Research Center (PMRC) forest.

## Running Code
The R scripts in this repository are designed to be modular. One can import the numbered scripts to sequentially perform commonly-repeated data ingest & cleansing tasks prior to performing analysis.

While the filenames are indicative of their general purpose, we recommend referring to the header comments in each script to identify its exact purpose, required inputs, and expected outputs.

## Updates & Code Submissions
To add new scripts, please follow the convention of creating personal branches for changes and submitting your branches for review via Pull Request. This is a best practice for ensuring uniformity of submissions and minimizing the possibility of overwrites or deletions.

Follow the instructions for [creating a branch here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository), as well as the instructions for [creating pull requests here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request).
